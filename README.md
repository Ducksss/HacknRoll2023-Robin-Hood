## Intro <a name="intro"></a>
This boilerplate is meant to be a quick start for creating chrome extensions using React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

> For improved DX and rapid building vite and nodemon are used.

> Chrome does not accept manifest v2 extensions since Jan 2022, therefore this template uses manifest v3.

> Firefox + other browsers don't yet support manifest v3, so cross browser usage is not encouraged.

* Read more about Chrome manifest v2 support [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/).
* Read more about Firefox Manifest v3 support [here](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/manifest-v3/94564).

As soon as Firefox supports manifest v3, support will be added in this repo as well.

## Why another boilerplate? <a name="why"></a>
I have used webpack react boilerplates and found it too hard to configure.

Vite is actually mega easy to understand, which makes it easier to get into and to maintain for others.

I couldn't find a boilerplate for React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. So here it is.

## Features <a name="features"></a>
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Chrome Extension Manifest Version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change `name` and `description` in package.json => **Auto synchronize with manifest** 
3. Run `yarn` or `npm i` (check your node version >= 16)
4. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
5. Load Extension on Chrome
   1. Open - Chrome browser
   2. Access - chrome://extensions
   3. Check - Developer mode
   4. Find - Load unpacked extension
   5. Select - `dist` folder in this project (after dev or build)
6. If you want to build in production, Just run `yarn build` or `npm run build`.

### Customization
As the template has **all** of the potential Chrome extension pages implemented, you likely have to 
customize it to fit your needs.

E.g. you don't want the newtab page to activate whenever you open a new tab:
1. remove the directory `newtab` and its contents in `src/pages`
2. remove the `newtab` rollup input in the `vite.config.ts`

```ts
//...
build: {
    outDir,
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        devtools: resolve(pagesDir, 'devtools', 'index.html'),
        panel: resolve(pagesDir, 'panel', 'index.html'),
        content: resolve(pagesDir, 'content', 'index.ts'),
        background: resolve(pagesDir, 'background', 'index.ts'),
        popup: resolve(pagesDir, 'popup', 'index.html'),
        newtab: resolve(pagesDir, 'newtab', 'index.html'),  // <--- REMOVE THIS LINE
        options: resolve(pagesDir, 'options', 'index.html'),
      },
      output: {
        entryFileNames: (chunk) => `src/pages/${chunk.name}/index.js`,
      },
    },
  },
/...
```

CSS files in the `src/pages/*` directories are not necessary. They are left in there in case you want 
to use it in combination with Tailwind CSS. **Feel free to delete them**.

Tailwind can be configured as usual in the `tailwind.config.cjs` file. See doc link below.
